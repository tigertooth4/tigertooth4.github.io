When I first came back to Beijing, I was shocked as I said before. There were too many things I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put up with. The most tough one to got along with, was the transportation system. People and cars were both jammed on road. Cars were definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t keep distance with people.

      <p>Title: Wrote after 25 days in Beijing</p>

<p>Date: 2013-09-09 02:52:08</p>

<p>When I first came back to Beijing, I was shocked as I said before. There were too many things I couldn&rsquo;t put up with. The most tough one to got along with, was the transportation system. People and cars were both jammed on road. Cars were definitely wouldn&rsquo;t keep distance with people.</p>

<p>As I wrote to Simon :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Board skating is not easy in Beijing. Because cars are always occupying the bike lane. And people are everywhere. Therefore I have to choose  my route very carefully. I feel it is not easy for me to keep doing things I like. But I still want to try. The weather is terribly humid and hot when I landed in Beijing and Hangzhou. I start to miss the blue sky in Davis now&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right now I would say I&rsquo;m much better. I went to the same coffee place every day for studying. It is pricy, but I was more productive. And in this way I could see more people, more healthy than stay at home.</p>

<p>I got my electric piano two days ago and found it very interesting to play with. I got my fixie today. It was a beautiful and neat bike with some minor issues, like the front fork was not feeling so stable and the crankset was to close to the rare fork. Maybe one day I should fix it.</p>

<p>I had a lots of dating with girls I don&rsquo;t like very much. Hope everything would become better eventually.</p>
