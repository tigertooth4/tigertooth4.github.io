I was really want to know the basic things about K-theory. It turns out it was not too difficult concept to learn. However, to understand it, one must know what’s this concept for? He didn’t answer me about that. But anyway, this is my first time to see the definition of K-theory. And he gave me a nice article, which was the base of his talk. The article was written by S.

If I have time, I’ll read this article.\nIn this afternoon, Piotr gave a talk about super-A-polynomial. I knows nothing about A-polynomial. It might related to knot invariant. He mentioned the Volume Conjecture, which is basically about whenever we define certain Chern-Simons shape partition function w.r.t. knots K, we basically have gotten some knot invariants (for example: Jones polynomial, colored Jones polynomial, HOMFLY polynomial etc. etc. And when we taking some limit, and the result expanding in a exponential function, then the leading term S0 will be related to an integral of some algebraic curve A(x,y).

I was thinking why we cannot do good research in China. A big reason is: in US people can communicate frequently without any difficulty.

Furthermore, in US professors love their research. While in China professors love their money more (This is definitely not in general.

<p>During the lunch, I asked Adam about his talk this morning. I was really want to know the basic things about K-theory. It turns out it was not too difficult concept to learn. However, to understand it, one must know what&rsquo;s this concept for? He didn&rsquo;t answer me about that. But anyway, this is my first time to see the definition of K-theory.

If I have time, I&rsquo;ll read this article.</p>
<p>In this afternoon, Piotr gave a talk about super-A-polynomial. I knows nothing about A-polynomial. It might related to knot invariant. He mentioned the <em>Volume Conjecture</em>, which is basically about whenever we define certain <em>Chern-Simons</em> shape partition function w.r.t. knots K, we basically have gotten some knot invariants (for example: <em>Jones polynomial</em>, <em>colored Jones polynomial</em>, <em>HOMFLY polynomial</em> etc. etc. And when we taking some limit, and the result expanding in a exponential function, then the leading term <em>S0</em> will be related to an integral of some algebraic curve A(x,y). Here are some references maybe I can see in the future:</p>

</ul>
<p>_</p>
<p>For me, I can continue reading <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0002v2" title="arXiv:1108.0002v2">arXiv:1108.0002v2</a> _A-polynomial, B-model, and Quantization _. And here are a lot of Prof. Zhou&rsquo;s paper I can read.</p>
<p>Here are Gukov&rsquo;s video about categrofication:</p>

<p>Then I would like to refer to some things I was thinking today. I was thinking why we cannot do good research in China.
