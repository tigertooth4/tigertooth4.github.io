The idea of approximating the length of a curve has no difference with the idea of approximating an area or approximating a volume. By subdividing the curve into many pieces and joining successive points of division by straight line segments, we can then pass through a limit process to find the “real” length of a curve. In this lecture, we show this process and discuss some examples and consequences.\nParametric Plane Curves Let $C$ be a curve given parametrically by the equation\n$$ x =f(t),\\quad \\text{and}\\quad y = g(t),\\quad a\\le t\\le b. $$\n Definition. (Smooth (Plane) Curve)\n If the functions $f$ and $g$ have continuous derivatives on $[a,b]$ ( that is, $f'(t)$ and $g'(t)$ are both continuous functions, such functions are called continuously differentiable) and $f'$ and $g'$ are not simultaneously zero. Then the curve $C$ is called a smooth curve.\nRemark\nIt is helpful to imagine the curve as the path of a particle moving from point $A = (f(a),g(a))$ at time $t=a$ to point $B=(f(b),g(b))$.\nExample. (Why $f'$ and $g'$ cannot be simultaneously zero?) A plane curve $x=t^2$ and $y=t^3$ ($t\\in[-1,1]$) are defined by functions with continuous derivatives. However, the plot shows there is a cusp when $t=0$, the reason being $f'(0)= g'(0)=0$.\nLength of a Parametrically Defined Curve For a plane curve $C: (x=f(t), y=g(t))$ , ($a\\le t\\le b$). Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuously differentiable. Set points $A = (f(a),g(a))$ and $B = (f(b),g(b))$. In sequel, we always assume the path from $A$ to $B$ is traversed exactly once as $t$ increases from $t=a$ to $t=b$.\n1. Partition We subdivide the closed interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ pieces\n$$ P: a=t_0 The partition $P$ induces a partition on the curve, as\n$$ A = P_0, P_1, \\cdots, P_n = B,\\quad \\text{where}\\quad P_k = (f(t_k),g(t_k)) $$\n2. Length for the straight line segments Each straight line segment joining the successive points of the partition has length\n$$ L_k = \\sqrt{(\\Delta x_k)^2 + (\\Delta y_k)^2} \\ = \\sqrt{[f(t_k)-f(t_{k-1}]^2 + [g(t_k) - g(t_{k-1})]^2} $$\n3. Approximating the curve length The summation of all the lengths for straight line segment is assumed to be a good approximation for the length of the curve.\n$$ \\text{Length of the curve }C\\approx \\sum_{k=1}^n L_k $$\nBy the Lagrange Mean Value Theorem , there are numbers $t_k^*$ and $t_k^{**}$ $\\in[t_{k-1},t_k]$ such that\n$$ \\Delta x_k = f(t_k)-f(t_{k-1}) = f'(t_k^*), \\Delta t_k,\\ \\Delta y_k = g(t_k)- g(t_{k-1}) = g'(t_k^{**}) , \\Delta t_k. $$\nThen\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^n L_k = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sqrt{(\\Delta x_k)^2 + (\\Delta y_k)^2}\\ = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sqrt{[f'(t_k^)]^2 + [g'(t_k^{**})]^2},\\Delta t_k\\=\\sum_{k=1}^n \\sqrt{[f'(t_k^)]^2 + [g'(t_k^{*})]^2},\\Delta t_k + \\text{error} $$\n4. Pass through the limit The above summation is not exactly a Riemann sum (It is a Riemann summation up to an “error term”). However, a theorem in Advanced Calculus shows the error approaches $0$ as $||P||\\to 0$. Therefore by passing through the limit process as $||P||\\to 0$, we obtain the following formula for the length of the curve $C$.\n Definition. (Length of a Parametric Curve)\n If a curve is defined parametrically by $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$, $a\\le t\\le b$, where $f'$ and $g'$are continuous on $[a,b]$, and $C$ is traversed exactly once as $t$ increases from $t=a$ to $t=b$, then the length of $C$ is the definite integral\n$$ L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2} dt $$\nRemark\nThe different choices for the parametrization of the curve $C$ doesn’t affect the value $L$ at all. As long as the parametrization meets the conditions stated in the definition of the length of $C$.\nExample 1. The Circumference of a Circle A circle with radius $r$ can be defined parametrically by\n$$ x=r\\cos(t),\\quad\\text{and}\\quad y=r\\sin(t),\\quad 0\\le t\\le 2\\pi. $$\nTherefore by using the definite integral we can see the length is $L=2\\pi r$.\nExample 2. The length of an astroid An astroid is defined by $x=\\cos^3(t)$ and $y=\\sin^3(t)$, with $0\\le t\\le 2\\pi.$\nThe length of the curve in the first-quadrant is $L=\\dfrac32.$\nSpecial Case: The Length of a Curve $y=f(x)$ Given a continuously differentiable function $y=f(x)$, $a\\le x\\le b$, we can assign $x=t$ as a parameter. The graph of the function $f$ is then the curve $C$ defined parametrically by\n$$ x=t,\\quad \\text{and} \\quad y=f(t),\\quad a\\le t\\le b. $$\nThen as a special case of parametric curve, the length of the graph $C$ is defined by\n Definition. The length of curve $y=f(x)$\n If $f$ is continuously differentiable on the closed interval $[a,b]$, then the length of the curve $y=f(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is\n$$ L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2}dx = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2} dx. $$\nExample 3. The arc-length of a graph A graph defined by\n$$ y=\\frac{4\\sqrt2}{3}x^{3/2} -1,\\quad 0\\le x\\le 1. $$\nis $L = \\dfrac{13}{6}.$\nExample 4. The length of a catenary A catenary is typically expressed as\n$$ y = c \\cosh(x/c),\\quad \\text a\\le x \\le b. $$\nDealing with Discontinuities in $dy/dx$ As a case when $dy/dx$ fails to exist, $dx/dy$ may exist. Therefore, we may be able to find the curve length by expressing $x$ as a function of $y$ instead.\nExample 5. Inverse the expression $y=f(x)$ to $x=g(y)$ Find the length of the curve $y=(x/2)^{2/3}$ from $x=0$ to $x=2.$ By express $x$ as a function of $y$ we find the length is approximately $L\\approx 2.27.$\nRefined Differential Formula for Length The length is frequently written in terms of differentials in place of derivatives. Recall that for function $x=f(t)$, the differential $dx$ is defined as\n$$ dx = df = f'(t) dt = \\frac{d x}{dt} dt $$\nSo the equation for length is written by\n$$ L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{(dx)^2+(dy)^2}. $$\nIt is customary to eliminate the parentheses in $(dx)^2$ and write $dx^2$ instead. So\n$$ L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} $$\nThis is a unified formula for length. For different cases, one must express $x$ and $y$ in suitable parametrization and restore the formula $L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g'(t)^2+g'(t)^2}dt$ to compute.\nA useful way is to write\n$$ ds = \\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} $$\nand treat $ds$ as the differential of arc-length (弧长微元), which can be integrated between appropriate limits to give the total length of a curve. The geometric meaning of $ds$ is shown below, as an approximation of length for tiny arc-segment. Then to memorize, first recall the shortest expression\n$$ L = \\int ds $$\nThen recall $ds = \\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}$, finally choose appropriate parametrization to expand $dx^2+dy^2$, as well as specify the the integral limits $a$ and $b$.\n",

<p>If a curve is defined parametrically by $x=f(t)$ and $y=g(t)$, $a\le t\le b$, where $f'$ and $g'$are continuous on $[a,b]$, and $C$ is traversed exactly once as $t$ increases from $t=a$ to $t=b$, then <strong>the length of $C$</strong> is the definite integral</p>
<p>$$
L = \int_a^b \sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2} dt
$$</p>
<p><strong><code>Remark</code></strong></p>
<p>The different choices for the parametrization of the curve $C$ doesn’t affect the value $L$ at all. As long as the parametrization meets the conditions stated in the definition of the length of $C$.</p>

<h1 id="refined-differential-formula-for-length">Refined Differential Formula for Length<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#refined-differential-formula-for-length">#</a></h1>
<p>The length is frequently written in terms of differentials in place of derivatives. Recall that for function $x=f(t)$, the differential $dx$ is defined as</p>
<p>$$
dx = df = f'(t) dt = \frac{d x}{dt} dt
$$</p>
<p>So the equation for length is written by</p>
<p>$$
L = \int_a^b \sqrt{(dx)^2+(dy)^2}.
$$</p>
<p>It is customary to eliminate the parentheses in $(dx)^2$ and write $dx^2$ instead. So</p>
<p>$$
L = \int_a^b \sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}
$$</p>
<p>This is a unified formula for length. For different cases, one must express $x$ and $y$ in suitable parametrization and restore the formula $L = \int_a^b \sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} = \int_a^b \sqrt{g'(t)^2+g'(t)^2}dt$ to compute.</p>
<p>A useful way is to write</p>
<p>$$
ds = \sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}
$$</p>
<p>and treat $ds$ as the <strong>differential of arc-length (弧长微元)</strong>, which can be integrated between appropriate limits to give the total length of a curve. The geometric meaning of $ds$ is shown below, as an approximation of length for tiny arc-segment. Then to memorize, first recall the shortest expression</p>
<p>$$
L = \int ds
$$</p>
<p>Then recall $ds = \sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}$, finally choose appropriate parametrization to expand $dx^2+dy^2$, as well as specify the the integral limits $a$ and $b$.</p>
