      <description>The year 2012 has passed for almost 20 days. I&amp;#8217;m a lazy blogger right ;-P. I really want to write something for my 2012. The reason for delay of writing was I had a math problem to solve. I was struggling a lot during the Christmas and new year holidays. I&amp;#8217;ve been working everyday to expect a solution for the final step of the proof: matching two pieces of expressions, one was from the Laplace transform, the other was from the Eynard-Orantin recursion formula.</description>
