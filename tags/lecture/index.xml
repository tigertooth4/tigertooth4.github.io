      <description>周次: 12 日期: May 13, 2022 节次: 2 In this lecture, we will talk about series, we introduce the sigma notation, and utilize limit to define the sum of a series. Primarily, there are two types of series whose sums can be found directly, by definition. Those are called Geometric Series and Telescoping Series. To study a divergent series, we introduce the $n$th term</description>
